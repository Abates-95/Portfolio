                    <p id="intro">If you have made it this far then you are aware my name is Austin.  
                        I currently am 27 years old waiting to turn 28 on May 23rd born in the year 1995!
                        Born and raised in a small town in Connecticut called Central Village is where I spent the first 14 years
                        of my life surrounded by my friends and family. For a few years afterwards I lived in the neighboring 
                        state of Rhode Island where I graduated high school and started my job
                        as an irrigation foreman which I did for 10 years until hanging up the boots this year, finally finding home in beautiful South Carolina.
                        A few of my hobbies would include tinkering with synthesizers weather it be creating full tracks or just sonically
                        exploring their limits, leather work is a recent hobby i have found to enjoy from pattern design to full on cut and dye.
                        I am beyond excited to start my new journey in life and to finally as an adult apply myself 100% and 
                        let nothing or no one limit who I am or what I can do!
